# üñºÔ∏è PRODIGY_CS_02 - VisualCryptor

**VisualCryptor** is a beginner-friendly Python tool for encrypting and decrypting images using simple pixel-level XOR manipulation.

---

## üîê How It Works

The tool applies an XOR operation to each RGB pixel value using a numeric key (0‚Äì255). Using the same key, you can decrypt the image back to its original form. While working on this, I was able to understand XOR-based obfuscation, practice Python scripting, and explore how data or payloads can be hidden in images for stealthy attacks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

**1. I started by creating a folder by running this command on my terminal**
```bash
mkdir Pixelcipher
cd Pixelcipher
```
2. Created the Python script that would foster the encryption and decryption of the image. You can copy and replicate when you try this

```bash
vim cipher.py
```
Paste the following code:

```python
from PIL import Image

def encrypt_image(image_path, key):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img = img.convert("RGB")
    encrypted = Image.new("RGB", img.size)
    width, height = img.size

    for x in range(width):
        for y in range(height):
            r, g, b = img.getpixel((x, y))
            encrypted.putpixel((x, y), (r ^ key, g ^ key, b ^ key))

    encrypted.save("encrypted.png")
    print("üîê Image encrypted and saved as 'encrypted.png'")

def decrypt_image(image_path, key):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img = img.convert("RGB")
    decrypted = Image.new("RGB", img.size)
    width, height = img.size

    for x in range(width):
        for y in range(height):
            r, g, b = img.getpixel((x, y))
            decrypted.putpixel((x, y), (r ^ key, g ^ key, b ^ key))

    decrypted.save("decrypted.png")
    print("üîì Image decrypted and saved as 'decrypted.png'")

def main():
    print("=== VisualCrypt: Image Encryption Tool ===")
    choice = input("Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? ").lower()
    path = input("Enter the image file path (e.g., sample.jpg): ")
    try:
        key = int(input("Enter a numeric key (0‚Äì255): "))
    except ValueError:
        print("‚ùå Invalid key. Must be a number between 0 and 255.")
        return

    if not (0 <= key <= 255):
        print("‚ùå Key must be between 0 and 255.")
        return

    if choice == 'encrypt':
        encrypt_image(path, key)
    elif choice == 'decrypt':
        decrypt_image(path, key)
    else:
        print("‚ùå Invalid choice.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. I then installed the Pillow library that would help with the image manipulation

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pillow
```
4. Added an image for encryption and decryption

```bash
cp ./img.jpg
```
5. I then ran the program

üîí To Encrypt:

```bash
python3 image_cipher.py
```
You will see:

```pgsql
=== VisualCrypt: Image Encryption Tool ===
Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? encrypt
Enter the image file path (e.g., sample.jpg): Pixel.jpg
Enter a numeric key (0‚Äì255): 255
‚û°Ô∏è Output: encrypted.png
```
üîì To Decrypt:

```bash
python3 image_cipher.py
```
You will see:

```pgsql
=== VisualCrypt: Image Encryption Tool ===
Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? decrypt
Enter the image file path (e.g., sample.jpg): encrypted.png
Enter a numeric key (0‚Äì255): 255
‚û°Ô∏è Output: decrypted.png
```
üìÅ File Structure

```pgsql
imagecipher/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cipher.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pixel.jpeg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encrypted.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ decrypted.png
```
